TravellingSalesmanSolver
========================

Basic algorithms for solving the travelling salesman problem in python.

These programs were written as example solutions to a first year undergraduate computing project I ran in June 2014. The programs avoid object orientation, and almost entirely use functional programming as the students only had limited programming experience.

The code most likely can be optimised for efficiency - but none of the solutions are particularly slow. My primary objective was to make the code readable to first year students.
